Federal Program Change – Notice of Intent and Equivalency Required
.

This Instruction describes a Federal Program Change that consolidates and updates OSHA’s field enforcement policies and procedures. States must have, as a part of their State Plan, formal written policies and procedures on all aspects of their compliance program, including inspections, targeting, citations, penalties, and post citation processes, which are at least as effective as the procedures in this revised Field Operations Manual (FOM). State Plans have the option of adopting identical or different, but at least as effective, enforcement policies as those contained in this FOM, and in doing so, State Plans must address each chapter and/or policy area in this manual. Significant changes to this manual are listed in section VII of this chapter.

An identical State Plan change is one in which the State Plan adopts the same program provisions as the federal program with the only differences being those modifications necessary to reflect a State Plan’s unique structure. With respect to this FOM, State Plans can adopt identically without adopting the internal OSHA administrative procedures set out in this manual, such as those relating to organizational structure and such matters as penalty collection. However, State Plans must provide for their own comparable internal administrative procedures and processes.

Within 60 days of the date of issuance of this Directive, State Plans must submit a notice of intent indicating if the State Plan will adopt or already has in place enforcement policies and procedures that are identical to or different from the federal program. State adoption, either identically or different, should be accomplished within six months. If adopting identically, the State Plan must provide the date of adoption to OSHA, due within 60 days of adoption. If the State Plan adopts or maintains enforcement policies that differ from the FOM, the State Plan must either post its different policies on its State Plan website and provide a link to OSHA, or provide OSHA with an electronic copy and the name and contact information of someone within the State Plan who can assist the public with obtaining a copy. This action must occur within 60 days of the date of adoption. OSHA will post summary information of the State Plan responses to this Instruction on its website.
