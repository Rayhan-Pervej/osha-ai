Executive Summary

This Chapter updates enforcement policies and procedures for enacting the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSH Act). This Chapter provides guidance on Agriculture and Maritime Industry Sectors.

Significant Changes

This chapter title has been revised from "Industry Sectors" to "Agriculture and Maritime Industry Sectors" to more accurately reflect the content of the chapter.

Table 10-1, "OSHA's Appropriations Act Exemptions for Farming Operations" has been updated to include only information that is relevant to agricultural inspections.

The definitions of pesticide handlers and agricultural workers were deleted because they did not accurately reflect the definitions in the Environmental Protection Agency's Worker Protection Standard, 40 CFR Part 170.

References to OSHA's Directive titled "OSHA Authority Over Vessels and Facilities on or Adjacent to U.S. Navigable Waters and on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS)" have been updated throughout to link to the most recent version of the Directive.

Expanded eligibility for reduction to include employers who have never been inspected.

Executive Summary

This Chapter updates enforcement policies and procedures for enacting the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSH Act). Congress recognized that other federal agencies possess authority over occupational safety and health matters in certain industries. To avoid a duplication of federal effort and to prevent conflict between different sets of regulations covering the same working condition, this Chapter provides guidance on OSHA jurisdictional matters.

Significant Changes

Chapter 17 provides updates and clarification to the general principles of the Two-pronged test, types of agencies preempting OSHA, the exercise of statutory authority, forms of statutory exercise, and the provisions of the OSH Act subject to Section 4(b)(1).
