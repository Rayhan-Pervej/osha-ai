AGRICULTURE AND MARITIME INDUSTRY SECTORS

Agriculture
.



Introduction
.

Special situations arising in the agriculture industry, which is regulated under
29 CFR Part 1928
and the
General Duty Clause
, are discussed in this section. Part 1928 covers occupational safety and health standards for "agricultural operations," which include, but are not limited to, egg farms, poultry farms, livestock grain and feed lot operations, dairy farms, horse farms, hog farms, fish farms, and fur-bearing animal farms. OSHA has very few standards that are applicable to this industry. Part 1928 sets forth a few standards in full and lists particular Part 1910 standards that apply to agricultural operations. Part 1910 standards not listed do not apply. The General Duty Clause can be used to address hazards not covered by these standards.

Definitions
.


Agricultural Operations
.

This term is not defined in
29 CFR Part 1928
. Generally, agricultural operations would include any activities involved in the growing and harvesting of crops, plants, vines, fruit trees, nut trees, ornamental plants, egg production, the raising of livestock (including poultry and fish), as well as livestock products. The Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission has ruled that activities integrally related to these core "agricultural operations" are also included within that term.
Darragh Company
,
9 BNA OSHC 1205
, (Nos. 77-2555, 77-3074, and 77-3075, 1980) (delivery of feed to chicken farmer by integrator of poultry products is agricultural operation);
Marion Stevens dba Chapman & Stephens Company
,
5 BNA OSHC 1395
(No.13535, 1977) (removal of pipe to maintain irrigation system in citrus grove is agricultural operation). Post-harvest activities not on a farm, such as receiving, cleaning, sorting, sizing, weighing, inspecting, stacking, packaging and shipping produce, are not "agricultural operations."
J. C. Watson Company
,
22 BNA OSHC 1235
(Nos. 05-0175 and 05-0176, 2008) (employer's onion packing shed was not an agricultural operation); J.C. Watson Company v. Solis, DC Cir. 08-1230 (April 17, 2009).

Agricultural Employee
.

OSHA regulation
§1975.4(b)(2)
states that members of the immediate family of the farm employer
are not
regarded as employees.

Farming Operation
.

This term is used in OSHA's
Appropriations Act
, and has been defined in
CPL 02-00-170
,
Enforcement Exemptions and Limitations under the Appropriations Act
, dated July 18, 2024, to mean any operation involved in the growing or harvesting of crops, the raising of livestock or poultry, or related activities conducted by a farmer on sites such as farms, ranches, orchards, dairy farms or similar farming operations.

These are employers engaged in businesses that have a three-digit North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) of 111 (Agricultural Production-Crops) and 112 (Agricultural Production-Livestock and Animal Specialties); and a six-digit NAICS of 115112 (Soil Preparation, Planting, and Cultivating), 115113 (Crop Harvesting, Primarily by Machine), 115115 (Farm Labor Contrac¬tors and Crew Leaders), and 115116 (Farm Management Services). CSHOs should follow
§1904.2(b)(2)
(i) - (iii) in determining the employer's primary NAICS classification.

Post-Harvesting Processing
.

This is a term that is used in
CPL 02-00-170
,
Enforcement Exemptions and Limitations under the Appropriations Act
, dated July 18, 2024, in discussing enforcement guidance for small farming operations. Generally, post-harvest processing can be thought of as changing the character of the product (such as canning, making cider or sauces, or butchering or processing animals) or a higher degree of packaging versus field sorting in a shed for size. These activities are not considered farming operations and thus are not exempt from OSHA enforcement.

Appropriations Act Exemptions for Farming Operations
.


Exempt Farming Operations
.

OSHA is limited by provisions in its Appropriations Act that refer to which employers it can inspect. Some of the Appropriations Act exemptions and limitations apply to small farming operations; specifically, OSHA shall not inspect any farming operations that (1) currently has 10 or fewer employees
and
has not had more than 10 employees at any time during the previous 12 months
and
(2) does not currently have an active temporary labor camp (TLC)
and
has not had any TLC activity within the prior 12 months.

Non-Exempt Farming Operations
.

A farming operation that currently has more than 10 employees or has had more than 10 employees at any time within the previous 12 months
is not
exempt from inspection. Similarly, a farming operation with 10 or fewer employees that maintains a temporary labor camp or has maintained a temporary labor camp within the last 12 months
is not
exempt from inspection.

State Plans
.

States with OSHA-approved State Plans can enforce on small farms and provide consultation or training, provided that (1) 100 percent state funds are used
and
(2) The state has an accounting system in place to ensure that no federal or matching state funds are expended on these activities.

Enforcement Guidance for Small Farming Operations
.

OSHA's Appropriations Act exempts qualifying small farming operations from enforcement or administration of
all
rules, regulations, standards, or orders under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, including rules affecting consultation and technical assistance or education and training services. Table 10-1, below, provides an at-a-glance reference to OSHA activities under the funding legislation.

Table 10-1: OSHA's Appropriation Act Exemptions for Farming Operations

Standards Applicable to Agriculture
.

OSHA has very few standards that apply to employers engaged in agricultural operations. Activities that take place after harvesting are considered general industry operations and are covered by OSHA's general industry standards.


Agricultural Standards (Part 1928)
.


Roll-over Protective Structures (ROPS) for Tractors (
§1928.51
,
1928.52
, and
1928.53
).

Guarding of Moving Machinery Parts of Farm Field Equipment, Farmstead Equipment, and Cotton Gins (
§1928.57
).

Field Sanitation (
§1928.110
). See
Section I.F
of this chapter,
Wage & Hour/OSHA Shared Authority under Secretary's Order.
, regarding Wage & Hour authority. OSHA has no authority to issue any citations under this standard.

General Industry Standards (Part 1910)
.


Temporary Labor Camps (
§1910.142
). See
Chapter 12, Section II
,
Temporary Labor Camps
.

Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia (
§1910.111(a)
and
(b)
).

Logging Operations (
§1910.266
).

Specifications for Accident Prevention Signs and Tags - Slow-Moving Vehicle Emblem (
§1910.145(d)(10)
).

Hazard Communication (
§1910.1200
).

Cadmium (
§1910.1027
).

Retention of Department of Transportation Markings, Placards and Labels (
§1910.1201
).

Except to the extent specified above, the standards contained in subparts B through T and subpart Z of Part 1910 of Title 29 do not apply to agricultural operations.

General Duty Clause
.

As in any situation where no standard is applicable,
Section 5(a)(1)
of the OSH Act can be used; all the elements for a Section 5(a)(1) citation must be met. This includes heat-related hazards. See Chapter 4, Section III,
General Duty Clause
.

Pesticides
.


Coverage
.


Pursuant to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has jurisdiction over employee protection relating to pesticides (which also includes herbicides, fungicides, and rodenticides). (See
OSHA/EPA MOU
). The EPA Worker Protection Standard (WPS) protects employees on farms, forests, nurseries, and greenhouses from occupational exposure to agricultural pesticides. The WPS includes provisions for personal protective equipment, labeling, employee notification, safety training, safety posters, decon-tamination supplies, emergency assistance, and restricted field entry. See
40 CFR Part 170
, Worker Protection Standard.

The regulation covers two types of employees:


➣
Pesticide Handlers
.

➣
Agricultural Workers
.

For all pesticide use, including uses not covered by
40 CFR Part 170
, it is a violation of FIFRA to use a registered pesticide in a manner inconsistent with its labeling. Thus, OSHA has no authority to issue any citations related to pesticide exposures, pursuant to
Section 4(b)(1)
of the OSH Act. In the event a CSHO encounters any cases of pesticide exposure or the lack of an appropriate pesticide label on containers, a referral shall be made to the local EPA office or to state agencies that administer pesticide laws.

EPA also has jurisdiction in non-agriculture situations where pesticides are being applied by pest control companies. This would include, but not be limited to, applications in and around factories, warehouses, office buildings, and personal residences. OSHA cannot cite the Hazard Communication standard in such situations.

OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard
.

Although OSHA will not cite employers covered under EPA's WPS with regard to hazard communication requirements for pesticides, agricultural employers who are otherwise covered by OSHA are still responsible for having a hazard communication program for all hazardous chemicals that are not considered pesticides.

Wage & Hour Division (WHD)/OSHA Shared Authority under Secretary's Order
.

Since 1997, WHD has had shared authority with OSHA over two standards: the Field Sanitation standard (
1928.110
), and the Temporary Labor Camp standard (
1910.142
). See Delegation of Authorities and Assignment of Responsibilities to the Assistant Secretary for Employment Standards and Other Officials in the Employment Standards Administration (Federal Register, January 2, 1997 (
62 FR 107
)) and Secretary's Order 5-2002: Delegation of Authority and Assignment of Responsibility to the Assistant Secretary for Occupational Safety and Health, Federal Register, October 22, 2002 (
67 FR 65007
).


Field Sanitation Standard
.


The WHD has sole federal enforcement authority for this standard, including the issuing of citations.

OSHA, therefore, shall not issue citations under this standard.

The provisions of the Field Sanitation standard are also applicable to reforestation activities involving "hand-labor operations" as defined by the standard. This position regarding reforestation activities was developed through extensive inter-agency discussions and was intended to provide, in the absence of a clear and unambiguous exemption of this activity from the provisions of the standard, the broadest possible coverage for these employees.

Temporary Labor Camp (TLC) Standard
.

Under the Secretary's Order, enforcement authority for the TLC standard is split between the WHD and OSHA. See Chapter 12 Section II,
Temporary Labor Camps
, for a detailed discussion on Temporary Labor Camps.

Compliance Interpretation Authority
.

WHD has sole interpretation authority for both the Field Sanitation and the Temporary Labor Camp standards, even over those temporary labor camp areas for which OSHA has enforcement authority. See Section II.C on Wage & Hour/OSHA Shared Authority Under Secretary's Order.

Standard Revision and Variance Authority
.

OSHA retains all authority for revisions of the Field Sanitation and the Temporary Labor Camp standards, as well as the evaluation and granting of temporary and permanent variances.

State Plan
.


Eight of the twenty-two jurisdictions (21 states and Puerto Rico) that have OSHA-approved State Plans covering private sector employment elected not to enforce the Field Sanitation standard in agriculture and the Temporary Labor Camp standard, except with respect to egg, poultry, red meat production, and post-harvesting processing of agricultural and horticultural commodities. Thus, WHD enforces these standards, except as noted above, in the following states: Alaska, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Minnesota, South Carolina, Utah, and Wyoming.

The remaining jurisdictions with OSHA-approved State Plans covering private sector employment have retained enforcement authority for the Field Sanitation and Temporary Labor Camp standards in agriculture.

See
OSHA/WHD MOU
.

Maritime
.

The maritime industry includes shipyard employment (shipbuilding, ship repair, shipbreaking, and related employments), marine cargo handling (longshoring and marine terminals), and other marine activities.

CSHO Maritime Webpage
.

OSHA's internal (Intranet) maritime webpage provides CSHOs with the following information:

Contact information for the Office of Maritime Enforcement (OME)

SAVEs (Standard Alleged Violation Elements) for the maritime industry standards. SAVEs and associated AVEs (Alleged Violation Elements) are available on the Intranet for all Part 1915, Part 1917 and Part 1918 standards. The Office of Maritime Enforcement is responsible for maintaining the maritime SAVEs.

Shipyard Employment (Part 1915).

Coverage
.


Shipyard employment includes the building, repairing, and breaking (scrapping, disposal, recycling) of vessels, or a section of a vessel, without regard to geographical location, and is covered by 29 CFR Part 1915 for Shipyard Employment (see
29 CFR 1910.11(b)
). Examples of vessels include, but are not limited to: ships, barges, fishing boats, work boats, cruise liners, and floating oil drilling rigs (i.e., mobile offshore drilling units). Area Offices should consult with RSOL when preparing citations for Part 1915 violations not occurring on U.S. navigable waters. Due to caselaw in the Third, Fifth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuit Courts of Appeals, in those states (DE, NJ, PA, USVI, MS, LA, TX, AK, AZ, CA, HI, Guam, AL, FA, GA), OSHA can only cite Part 1915 if the work occurs on U.S. navigable waters. Note, however, that this limitation does not apply to violations of Subpart B (confined spaces), Subpart F (General Working Conditions), Subpart I (PPE), and Subpart P (fire protection), since these subparts expressly apply regardless of geographical location. In addition, when Part 1915 violations involve exposure to crew members only, the Area Office should consult with RSOL.

Shipyard employment involves work activities aboard floating vessels as well as vessel-related work activities on the land, docks, or piers, of a shipyard. Although
29 CFR Part 1915
covers many hazards in shipyard employment, it does not cover all such hazards. Therefore, some of the
29 CFR Part 1910
General Industry Standards are also applicable in shipyard employment. (See Appendix A of
CPL 02-00-162
,
Shipyard Employment "Tool Bag" Directive
, May 22, 2019).

NOTE
: Not all activities within a shipyard are considered shipyard employment covered by
29 CFR Part 1915
. For example, erection of a new building, roadway construction, demolition activities (including the dismantling of cranes), and the installation of water pipes are covered by Construction Standards,
29 CFR Part 1926
.

Shipyard Authority
.


U.S. Coast Guard
.


➣ OSHA and the U.S. Coast Guard each have authority over shipyard employment activities. The U.S. Coast Guard regulates working conditions for seamen (crew members) on inspected vessels through
46 CFR 90.05-1
. OSHA has authority to cite shipyard employment activities on inspected vessels if the work is performed by shipyard employees (non-crew members).

➣
NOTE
: An inspected vessel is any ship, boat, or barge, that has or is required to have a Certificate of Inspection (COI) issued by the U.S. Coast Guard. On uninspected vessels, OSHA has authority to cite shipyard employers for all working conditions. OSHA also can cite the owners or operators of uninspected vessels for violations involving shipbuilding, shipbreaking, and ship repair operations regardless of whether the work is performed by seamen (crew members) or by non-crew members unless the hazards are covered by U.S. Coast Guard regulations. (See Section XIV.B.1. in
CPL 02-01-066
-
OSHA Authority over Vessels and Facilities on or Adjacent to U.S. Navigable Waters and on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS)
, November 13, 2024.)

CSHOs should contact the vessel owner, master, or captain of the Port obtain the vessel identification or official number (VIN or ON). That information can be used in the
Port State Information Exchange
website to determine if the vessel has a COI. In addition, the Area Office may consult with the local U.S. Coast Guard office to determine whether the vessel has a COI or is supposed to have a COI as required by 46 CFR Part 2.

U.S. Navy
.

Under the OSH Act, OSHA has authority over shipyard employment aboard U.S. Navy vessels and within a U.S. Navy shipyard when the work is performed by a contractor. U.S. Navy civilian personnel are covered under
Presidential Executive Order 12196
, implemented by
29 CFR Part 1960
. There are no geographic limitations of OSHA's coverage for Executive Branch federal civilian employees who are not performing uniquely military operations as defined in
29 CFR 1960.2(i)
. Therefore, OSHA's authority extends to all federal civil service mariners (CIVMARs) in the U.S. Navy's Military Sealift Command (MSC).

OSHA does not cover Armed Forces personnel (uniformed military both active and reserve) such as: U.S. Navy (including MSC military department (MILDEPT)), U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Space Force, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard. However, OSHA does cover uniformed services of the commissioned corps of NOAA and the Public Health Service.

State Pans
.


➣
Private Sector Employees
.

States that operate their own OSHA-approved State Plans can elect to exercise authority over private sector maritime employees. States that have authority to exercise safety and health standards over private sector, land-side shipyard employment activities are:
California
,
Minnesota
,
Vermont
, and
Washington
. (See the State Plan standards in
29 CFR Part 1952
of these states for specific areas of authority.) However, OSHA retains authority in these four States on U.S. navigable waters. In the remaining states, OSHA has authority over all shipyard employees whether working land-side or on U.S. navigable waters.

NOTE
: U.S. navigable waters include graving-docks, dry-docks, lifting-docks, and marine railways (i.e., federal jurisdiction).

➣
Public Sector Employees
.

State Plans have authority over employees of state and local governments (e.g., port authorities, cities, counties), on both the land-side areas and aboard vessels. OSHA has no authority over "…any State or political subdivisions of a State."
Section 3(5) of the OSH Act, 29 U.S.C. 652(5)
.

Shipyard Inspections
.


Inspection Scheduling
.

The shipyard employment industry is made up of several industrial activities. Due to the unique differences among these activities, and differing yard locations, sizes, and number of employers, several scheduling methods are necessary. Consequently, shipyard employment inspections can be scheduled under National Emphasis Programs (NEPs), Regional Emphasis Programs (REPs), Special Emphasis Programs (SEPs), Local Emphasis Programs (LEPs), the Severe Violator Enforcement Program (SVEP), or from lists developed in accordance with
CPL 02-00-025
,
Scheduling System for Programmed Inspections
, January 4, 1995. However,
Chapter 2 of the FOM
will take precedence over CPL 02-00-025 when there is a divergence between the two instructions.


➣
National Emphasis Programs (NEPs)
.

Guidance for conducting NEP inspections in the shipyard employment industry can be found on the
OSHA public webpage
and includes:


CPL 03-00-020,
OSHA's National Emphasis Program (NEP) on Shipbreaking
, March 7, 2016;

CPL 03-00-009
,
National Emphasis Program-Lead
, August 14, 2008;

CPL 03-00-023
,
National Emphasis Program: Crystalline Silica
, February 4, 2020 (See also
Safety and Health Topics: Silica, Crystalline
);

CPL 02-02-076
,
National Emphasis Program - Hexavalent Chromium
, February 23, 2010; and

CPL 03-00-025
,
National Emphasis Program - Falls
, May 1, 2023.

NOTE
: All other scheduled shipyard employment inspections can be conducted under LEPs that support DOL's Strategic Plan and OSHA's Agency Management Plan goals.

➣
Local Emphasis Programs (LEPs)
.

LEPs are a type of Special Emphasis Program in which one or more area offices in a region participate. LEPs can be originated at the area or regional office level and should follow
CPL 04-00-002
,
Procedures for Approval of Local Emphasis Programs (LEPs)
, November 13, 2018.

LEPs are generally based on knowledge and experience of local industry hazards, injuries, and illnesses. The LEP effective period is specified in the directive and will not exceed five years. LEPs can include targeting of employers with 10 or fewer employees, as long as they do not conflict with restrictions under congressional appropriations act riders described in OSHA Instruction
CPL 02-00-170
,
Enforcement Exemptions and Limitations under the Appropriations Act
, dated July 18, 2024 or successor guidance.

The most recent list of OSHA Local Emphasis Programs (LEPs) in effect is available on the
OSHA public webpage
.

➣
Severe Violator Enforcement Program (SVEP)
.

This program is intended as a means to focus on employers who have demonstrated indifference to their OSH Act obligations by committing willful, repeated, or failure-to-abate violations. (See
Severe Violator Enforcement Program (SVEP)
directive, CPL 02-00-169, September 15, 2022
.) Enforcement actions for severe violator cases include mandatory follow-up inspections, increased company/corporate awareness of OSHA enforcement, corporate-wide agreements, enhanced settlement provisions, and federal court enforcement under Section 11(b) of the OSH Act.



If an unprogrammed inspection arises for an establishment that is to receive a follow-up inspection or additional targeted inspection as a result of the SVEP, the two inspections can be conducted either concurrently or separately. The SVEP does not affect in any way the conduct of unprogrammed inspections.

Some establishments can be selected for inspection under the SVEP and also under other OSHA initiatives such as National Emphasis Programs (NEPs), Regional Emphasis Programs (REPs), or Local Emphasis Programs (LEPs). These other programs run concurrently with the SVEP.

➣
Inspection Lists
.

All fixed maritime (shipyard) establishments shall be scheduled and inspected by either using an industry rank report or establishment lists as detailed in
CPL 02-00-025
.

The Area Director shall compile a complete list of active establishments (worksites) considering all establishments within the coverage of the office and using the best available information (internet and local listings, local knowledge, shipyard and boatyard lists provided by OME, etc.). Inspection lists can be compiled in various ways. Two ways that have been used successfully in scheduling shipyard inspections are:

List by Port Area
; or

A list of shipyard sites by port areas can be prepared at the beginning of the fiscal year by the Area Office, using LEP inspection lists, local knowledge, and experience.

List by Employer
.

A list of all shipyard industry employers within the Area Office's jurisdiction can be prepared, using LEP inspection lists, local knowledge, and experience.

CSHO Training
.

The OTI Course #2090,
Shipyard Employment
introduces shipyard operations and standards, including the jurisdictional considerations of enforcement. This course covers ship building, repair, breaking, and barge cleaning, and the application of shipyard standards. The course consists of several workshops where the student will have to analyze various scenarios to determine the hazard(s), related standard(s), and apply corrective actions. Course highlights include a field trip to an operating shipyard for a shipyard orientation, and to review the processes involved in building a ship.

CSHO Preparation
.

In addition to normal inspection preparation procedures, CSHOs must be properly equipped and attired. All necessary personal protective equipment (PPE) must be available for use and in proper operating condition. CSHOs must be trained in the uses and limitations of PPE before beginning the inspection. At the opening conference, the CSHO will request a copy of the employer's certification of hazard assessment prepared in accordance with
29 CFR 1915.152(b)
in order to be aware of the necessary PPE. The suggested minimum PPE for a CSHO is: a safety helmet, safety shoes, gloves, eye protection, hearing protection, a personal flotation device (PFD), and a high-visibility/retro-reflective vest. Additional PPE, such as a respirator, can be required if conditions warrant. All testing and monitoring equipment must be calibrated (if necessary) and in good condition. It may be advisable for a CSHO to carry a multi-gas meter when conducting a vessel inspection to test for O2, H2S, CO, and/or LEL.

Safety and Health Rules at Shipyards
.

Under
29 CFR 1903.7(c)
, CSHOs must comply with all site safety and health rules and practices at a shipyard or on a vessel, and must wear or use the safety clothing or protective equipment required by OSHA standards or by the employer for the protection of employees.

Inspection Data
.

Inspection data
is accessible through OSHA's webpage. This "Statistics & Data" page will allow the user to conduct searches by establishment, Standard Identification Classification (SIC) code, North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code, OSHA inspection number, accidents, and frequently cited standards.

Leased Employees and Employer Responsibilities
.

Many shipyards use contract or temporary leased employees. The company on whose payroll the employee is listed, as well as the company that supervises and controls the employee's activities, can be regarded as the employer. However, only the company that supervises the employee's daily work activities is responsible for injury and illness recordkeeping for that employee. (See the OSHA/NIOSH Publication,
Recommended Practices: Protecting Temporary Workers
OSHA Temporary Worker Initiative Bulletin #11,
Safety and Health in Shipyard Employment
.)

Multi-Employer Worksites
.

More than one employer can be liable for a hazardous condition that violates an OSHA standard. The process that must be followed in determining whether more than one employer is liable for employee safety and health conditions can be found in OSHA Instruction
CPL 02-00-124
,
Multi-Employer Citation Policy
, December 10, 1999. See also the multi-employer worksite provisions in
29 CFR 1915.12(f)
and
29 CFR 1915.501
. The Regional Solicitor's Office is available to address issues concerning the application of the multi-employer citation policy after approval from the respective Regional Administrator.

1915.115(a)
and
CPL 02-01-055
, Maritime Cargo Gear Standards and 29 CFR 1919 Certification, September 30, 2013.)

Marine Cargo Handling Industry (Parts 1917 & 1918)

Coverage
.

The marine cargo handling industry includes:


Longshoring and related employment aboard a vessel Longshoring is the loading, unloading, moving, or handling of cargo, ship's stores, gear, or any other materials into, in, on, or out of any vessel Related employment is any employment performed incidental to or in conjunction with longshoring, including securing cargo, rigging, and employment as a porter, clerk, checker, or security officer (see
29 CFR 1918.2
); and

Marine terminal (on shore) employment, as defined in
29 CFR 1917.1
, includes the loading, unloading, movement or other handling of cargo, ship's stores, or gear within the terminal or into or out of any land carrier, holding or consolidation area, and any other activity within and associated with the overall operations and functions of the terminal, except as noted in the standards It includes all cargo transfers using shore-based material handling devices (See
CPL 02-00-154
,
Longshoring and Marine Terminals "Tool Shed" Directive
, July 31, 2012.)

Marine Cargo Handling Authority
.


U.S. Coast Guard
.

OSHA has authority to cite employers engaged in longshoring and marine terminal operations; U.S. Coast Guard regulations do not preempt OSHA from citing such employers. On inspected vessels, OSHA has no authority to cite the owner or operator of the vessel with respect to any working conditions of seamen (crew members) regardless of the work they are performing. On uninspected vessels OSHA can cite the owner or operator of the vessel for any violation of working conditions affecting seamen or non-seamen, unless the hazards are covered by U.S. Coast Guard regulations. (See
CPL 02-01-066
,
OSHA Authority over Vessels and Facilities on or Adjacent to U.S. Navigable Waters and on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS)
, November 13, 2024.)

U.S. Navy
.

OSHA has authority under the OSH Act over longshoring operations aboard U.S. Navy vessels and within a marine terminal at a U.S. Navy facility when the work is performed by a contractor. U.S. Navy civilian personnel are covered under
Presidential Executive Order 12196
, implemented by
29 CFR Part 1960
. There are no geographic limitations of OSHA's coverage for Executive Branch federal civilian employees who are not performing uniquely military operations as defined in
29 CFR 1960.2(i)
. Therefore, OSHA's authority extends to all federal civil service mariners (CIVMARs) in the U.S. Navy's Military Sealift Command (MSC).

Note
: OSHA does not cover Armed Forces personnel (uniformed military both active and reserve) such as: U.S. Navy (including MSC military department (MILDEPT)), U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Space Force, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard. However, OSHA does cover uniformed services of the commissioned corps of NOAA and the Public Health Service.

State Plans
.


➣
Private Sector Employees
.

States that operate their own OSHA-approved State Plans can elect to exercise authority over private sector maritime employees. States that have authority to exercise safety and health standards over private sector, land-side marine terminal employment activities are:
California
,
Minnesota
,
Vermont
, and
Washington
. (See the State Plan standards in
29 CFR Part 1952
, of these states for specific areas of authority.) However, OSHA retains authority in these four states on U.S. navigable waters (i.e., longshoring employment). In the remaining states, OSHA has authority over all marine cargo handling employees whether working land-side or on U.S. navigable waters.

➣
Public Sector Employees
.

State Plans have authority over employees of state and local governments (e.g., port authorities, cities, counties), on both the land-side areas and aboard vessels. OSHA has no authority over "…any State or political subdivisions of a State." Section 3(5) of the OSH Act, 29 U.S.C. 652(5).

Marine Cargo Handling Inspections
.


Inspection Scheduling
.

The marine cargo handling industry is made up of longshoring activities (i.e., cargo handing aboard vessels) and activities within marine terminals (i.e., cargo handling ashore). Due to the unique differences among these activities and differing port locations, sizes, and number of employers (i.e., stevedores), several scheduling methods are necessary. Consequently, marine cargo handling industry inspections can be scheduled as National Emphasis Programs (NEPs), Special Emphasis Programs (SEPs), Regional Emphasis Programs (REPs), Local Emphasis Programs (LEPs), the Severe Violator Enforcement Program (SVEP), or from lists developed in accordance with
CPL 02-00-025
,
Scheduling System for Programmed Inspections
, January 4, 1995. However, this Instruction will take precedence over CPL 02-00-025 when there is a divergence between the two instructions.


➣
National Emphasis Programs (NEPs)
.

Guidance for conducting NEP inspections in the marine cargo handling industry includes:


CPL 03-00-009
,
National Emphasis Program-Lead
, August 14, 2008; and

NOTE
: All other scheduled marine cargo handling inspections can be conducted under LEPs that support DOL's Strategic Plan and OSHA's Agency Management Plan goals.

➣
Local Emphasis Programs (LEPs)
.

LEPs are a type of Special Emphasis Program in which one or more area offices in a region participate. LEPs can be originated at the area or regional office level and should follow
CPL 04-00-002
,
Procedures for Approval of Local Emphasis Programs (LEPs)
, November 13, 2018.

LEPs are generally based on knowledge and experience of local industry hazards, injuries, and illnesses. LEPs can include targeting of employers with 10 or fewer employees, as long as they do not conflict with restrictions under congressional appropriations act riders described in OSHA Instruction
CPL 02-00-170
,
Enforcement Exemptions and Limitations under the Appropriations Act
, dated July 18, 2024 or successor guidance.

The most recent list of OSHA Local Emphasis Programs (LEPs) in effect is available at the Directorate of Enforcement Program's Intranet page.

➣
Severe Violator Enforcement Program (SVEP)
.

This program concentrates resources on inspecting employers who have demonstrated indifference to their OSH Act obligations by committing willful, repeated, or failure-to-abate violations. (See
Severe Violator Enforcement Program (SVEP)
Directive, CPL 02-00-169, September 15, 2022
.) Enforcement actions for severe violator cases include mandatory follow-up inspections and, where appropriate, ensure increased company/corporate awareness of OSHA enforcement actions, corporate-wide agreements, enhanced settlement provisions, and federal court enforcement under Section 11(b) of the OSH Act. It also provides for nationwide referral procedures, which include OSHA's State Plans.

If an unprogrammed inspection arises for an establishment that is to receive a follow-up inspection or additional targeted inspection as a result of the SVEP, then the two inspections can be conducted either concurrently or separately. The SVEP does not affect in any way the conduct of unprogrammed inspections.

Some establishments can be selected for inspection under the SVEP and also under other OSHA initiatives such as National Emphasis Programs (NEPs), Regional Emphasis Programs (REPs), or Local Emphasis Programs (LEPs). These other programs can be run concurrently with the SVEP.

➣
Inspection Lists
.

Water transportation services inspection lists can be developed either by port area or by employer.


List by Port Area
.

A list of port areas can be prepared at the beginning of the fiscal year by the Area Director, using OSHA inspection history, local knowledge and experience, company schedules, and information from other sources. For example, the Port of Savannah might be subdivided into three port areas; the Port of Houston might be subdivided into eight or more port areas. Other large ports can be subdivided in the same manner.

List by Employer
.

A list of all water transportation services employers within the Area Office's jurisdiction can be prepared, based on OSHA inspection history, local knowledge and experience, company schedules, and other sources.

NOTE
: Due to differing locations, loading/unloading equipment, products, site conditions, or any other reasons determined by the CSHO, he/she can inspect multiple worksites (i.e., vessels) being worked by the same employer. Each vessel shall be considered a separate inspection for recording purposes.

CSHO Training and Preparation
.

The OTI Course #2060,
Longshoring and Marine Terminal Processes and Standards
, introduces longshoring, covers vessel and equipment nomenclature and the application of the longshoring and marine terminal standards. Course highlights include field exercises at a working vessel or landship for longshoring orientation. CSHO Preparation.

In addition to normal inspection preparation procedures, CSHOs must be properly equipped and attired. All necessary personal protective equipment (PPE) must be available for use and in proper operating condition. CSHOs must be trained in the uses and limitations of PPE before beginning the inspection. The suggested minimum PPE for a CSHO is a safety helmet, safety shoes, gloves, eye protection, hearing protection, a personal flotation device (PFD), and a high-visibility/retro-reflective vest. Additional PPE can be required, such as a respirator, if conditions warrant. All testing and monitoring equipment must be calibrated (if necessary) and in good condition. It may be advisable for a CSHO to carry a multi-gas meter when conducting a vessel inspection to test for O2, H2S, CO, and/or LEL.

Safety and Health Rules at a Marine Cargo Handling Facility
.

29 CFR 1903.7(c) requires CSHOs to comply with all site safety and health rules and practices at marine cargo handling facility or vessel, and to wear or use the safety clothing or protective equipment required by OSHA standards or by the employer for the protection of employees.

Inspection Procedures
.


➣ A CSHO shall gain access to a marine terminal by following local security measures (see also Section III.E of this chapter, Security Procedures, for more information). When a longshoring operation inspection involves only a stevedoring company (i.e., a company that hires longshoring employees) and does not involve the marine terminal operator, the CSHO shall go directly to the vessel to initiate the inspection. The employer's representative (such as a superintendent, crew leader, supervisor, or hatch boss) and an employee representative (if applicable) will be contacted, and the opening conference held. The inspection will usually be limited to the vessel being worked by the stevedore. When the stevedore and the terminal operator are the same, an inspection of both the terminal and vessel will typically be conducted when Federal OSHA has authority.

➣ A CSHO shall always notify the master of the vessel (i.e., captain) or have the stevedore's representative notify the master prior to performing the walkaround portion of the inspection on a vessel.

Inspection Data
.

Inspection data
is accessible through OSHA's webpage. This "Statistics & Data" page will allow the user to conduct searches by establishment, Standard Identification Classification (SIC) code, North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code, OSHA inspection number, accidents, and frequently cited standards.

Renewable Energy Facilities on the OCS
. -The
Department of Interior (DOI) Policy Statement on Regulating Workplace Safety and Health Conditions on Renewable Energy Facilities on the Outer Continental Shelf
went into effect on October 18, 2019. The Policy Statement provides that the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) of DOI will act as the principal Federal agency for the enforcement of safety and health requirements for OCS renewable energy facilities by creating a Safety Management System (SMS) that addresses risks associated with construction, operation, maintenance, and decommissioning of renewable energy facilities. DOI considers its regulatory program to occupy the field of workplace renewable energy facilities, and to preempt the applicability of the OSHA requirements, including recordkeeping and reporting regulations. See 29
U.S.C. 653(b)(1)
. In carrying out its responsibilities on the OCS, DOI will collaborate and consult with OSHA (which serves in a non-regulatory role) on workplace safety and health matters for the offshore wind industry and other offshore renewable energy industries.

Keeping Workers Safe During Oil Spill Response and Cleanup Operations
, compiles safety and health information for workers conducting such operations including: multi-lingual fact sheets and guidance documents, oil spill training materials, national response system information, and many other resources relating to oil spills and cleanup operations.

Other Regulatory Agencies
.

During a maritime inspection, CSHOs may encounter other regulatory agencies such as, but not limited to, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), including the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA); U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE); Department of Transportation (DOT); Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE); Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE): Federal Railroad Administration (FRA); Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA); Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC); and Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS). CSHOs should contact the Office of Maritime Enforcement for any questions about OSHA coverage and/or coordination with other agencies or consult CPL
02-01-066
,
OSHA Authority Over Vessels and Facilities on or Adjacent to U.S. Navigable Waters and on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS)
.

Security Procedures
.


Transportation Worker Identification Card (TWIC)
.

The TWIC program is a Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and U.S. Coast Guard initiative. The TWIC program provides a tamper-resistant biometric credential to maritime workers requiring unescorted access to secure areas of port facilities, outer continental shelf facilities, and vessels regulated under the
Maritime Transportation Security Act
(MTSA); and all U.S. Coast Guard credentialed merchant mariners. An estimated 750,000 individuals require TWICs.

NOTE
: A CSHO's credentials and government identification card are equivalent to a TWIC for the purposes of access to and escorting non-TWIC holders on maritime facilities (see
Redefining Secure Areas and Acceptable Access Control
, January 7, 2008, and
TWIC & Law Enforcement Officials & Other Regulatory Agencies
, November 21, 2007). Should problems arise, the CSHO should contact the local U.S. Coast Guard office (
http://homeport.uscg.mil
) to obtain resolution and access. Difficulties in obtaining access to maritime facilities using CSHO credentials and a government identification card should be reported by the Regional Administrator to the Directorate of Enforcement Programs, Office of Maritime Enforcement at 202-693-2399.

Photography and Security at U.S. Navy Worksites
.

Area Directors should establish a photography and security policy agreement with an installation prior to conducting inspections. The U.S. Navy has advised its shore and afloat (ship) activities that permission is granted for Federal OSHA compliance officials to conduct safety and health inspections and investigations of U.S. Navy civilian and contractor workplaces. CSHOs will be required to present appropriate identifying credentials and a government identification card; also, for entry into nuclear, explosive, and other security-sensitive areas, a security clearance may be required. CSHOs shall be required to possess appropriate security clearances for entry into areas where the workplace is situated.

The current U.S. Navy policy prohibits OSHA compliance officials from taking photographs. CSHOs can request that photographs of safety and health conditions to be taken by U.S. Navy personnel. Any photographs taken by the U.S. Navy will initially be classified CONFIDENTIAL and shall not be delivered to OSHA compliance officials until all photographs have been fully screened and censored, as appropriate, in the interest of national security. Screening officials will normally complete this process within 15 days. Also, any design or system performance data (e.g., recordings of noise sound level profiles and light level readings) shall be screened by the U.S. Navy prior to release to OSHA. See chapter 11 in
OPNAV 5100.23G
